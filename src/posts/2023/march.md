2023 can't be all AI work and no play.

Nate Denlinger will talk about how he build an AI pong game from scratch!

Typically, AI/ML engineers use an ML framework: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch etc. to build their networks.
Nate wanted to learn how these frameworks worked under the hood.  
So without any library imports built an 
AI Pong in pure Javascript!  

Come learn and play with how neural networks work under the hood.  
It only seems like magic, however it really is just math.  

In addition, he pushed his game up to the Github so that you too can play along.
