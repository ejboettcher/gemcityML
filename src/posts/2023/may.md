The WBI Machine Learning Collider will be a collaboration between  Gem City ML and WBI and  will be on May 18th from 1-4pm at WBI.

The Wright Brothers Institute (WBI) mission is to support AFRL and help bring in innovation and small businesses. They have monthly colliders that focus on different topics to support small businesses innovations for AFRL.

Gem City ML (www.Gemcityml.com) is a local meetup group that meets once a month at the Hub in downtown Dayton, OH. We meet to explore the exciting and growing field of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our goal is to have a space where people can present and learn new ML/AI ideas, ask for help on problems they are working on, and meet new people.

ML/AI has taken off and there are many aspects that it touches.  In this Collider, we give the community some perspective on how vast, hard and different it is in the DoD. Several speakers will give a presentation on an aspect of AI/ML inside the fence.
