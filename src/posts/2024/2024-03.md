## LLM and TAK a use case

Cognitive Think Tank and GemCity ML are co-hosting an event this March 28st. Layla Akilan (Human Machine Teaming SME) will go over a use case of trying to incorporate LLM capabilities to data limited devices (smart phones, tablets). This focus will be on AFRLâ€™s Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) and LLM. TAK is an android platform for secure and approved applications for both civilian and military use.

This event will be online.
In addition, we will have a watch party at the Hub too.
