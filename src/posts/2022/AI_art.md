Zero Sum Games (but one real winner!)
December's Machine Learning Group will be loosely based on GANs. GANs (generative adversarial networks) are a class of machine learning frameworks where neural networks (NN) compete in a zero sum game.

In this spirit, I am having a competition of AI generated Dayton Themed Art.

Break down:
Generative Model: Your choice
Discriminator Model: Your Peers
Training set: Your rich knowledge of Dayton
Output: Dayton Themed GAN's / AI generated Art
Prizes: Bragging rights! and choice of a frame-able print or T-shirt of the BEST Dayton themed art.
