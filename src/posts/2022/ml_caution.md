A walk through a personal project that my family 
used to protect our child from unauthorized social media posts. 
Scanning multiple social media posts is too time-consuming for parents to do, 
however it is not that CPU intensive. 

We used an open source face recognition algorithm (https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) 
combined with some API scrubbers to automatically pull images from posts and check 
to see if your child was in it and then email any photos that might have them in it.
