Dayton’s Original Pizza Factory moved to Dayton’s South Park Historic District at 1101 Wayne Ave. in 1996 and has been operating there ever since.  The business added a dine-in restaurant two blocks away in 2006 called the South Park Tavern and enjoyed introducing it’s neighbors and many Daytonians to the craft beer wave of the mid-late aughts decade.  The South Park Tavern was sold in 2017, but Dayton’s Original Pizza Factory continues to offer craft beer, cider, and wine available for delivery along with our tasty pizzas, grinder subs, and fresh salads.
