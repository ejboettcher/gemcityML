The [Gem City Machine Learning (ML)](https://www.meetup.com/gem-city-tech/) group is part of the GemCity TECH family of user communities. 

Each month we meet at the Innovation Hub located in the newly renovated Downtown Dayton Arcade. 
We meet to explore the exciting and growing field of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).


We regularly meet on the third Thursday of the month. You can find our next event on 
the [GemCity TECH Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/gem-city-tech/) events calendar.


* Would you like to discover more about machine learning or artificial intelligence?
* Are you interested in being part of a community who are also interested in exploring the field of machine learning?
* Do you work in the field of machine learning and would like to share your knowledge and experience?



<br>


Our goal is to have a space where people can present and learn new ML/AI ideas, 
ask for help on problems they are working on, and meet new people.

<br>

We have short talks about machine learning (ML) and how to get into this field. 

<br>

The format is:

* Social: ~ 30 min
* Lecture: ~ 1 hour
* Social: ~ 30 min
